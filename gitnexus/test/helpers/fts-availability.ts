 * runs (no env var) still skip gracefully (#2299).
 *
 * Self-sufficient under sharding: the default load path is `load-only`, so these
 * primitives only pass when *some other* test already installed FTS into the
 * shared home. That co-location is not guaranteed once the cross-platform suite
 * is sharded (a load-only file can land in a shard with no installer sibling —
 * exactly what broke `lbug-core-adapter` on shard 2/3). So under REQUIRE_FTS we
 * install-on-miss with `auto` (LOAD-first, then one bounded network INSTALL),
